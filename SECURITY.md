## Reporting a Vulnerability

When you find a security vulnerability open a issue with the label *VULNERABILITY* and explain what the vulnerability is.
Explain the steps to reproduce the security vulnerability so the vulnerability can be investigated.
If it is found that there is a security vulnerability we will post a security advisory and start working on a fix.
